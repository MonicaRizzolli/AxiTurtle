# AxiTurtle

An easy way to program AxiDraw and preview your drawing.
Including turtle graphics commands!

Based on EvilMadScientist's AxiGen example, hiding it's complexity,
but providing an easy (turtle graphics) programming interface.

Turtle graphics commands are based on "Laser Turtle":

The turtle starts in the upper left corner facing right.
Angles: 0 is right, 1/4 is up, 1/2 is left, 3/4 is down

## Pen commands
penUp();               // Shortcut u()

penDown();             // d()

## Relative move
moveForward(distance); // f()

## Relative turns
turnRight(angle);      // r()

turnLeft(angle);       // l()

## Absolute turns
turnTo(angle);         // t()

Angles for turn commands are 0.0 to 1.0

turnRight(1/4);        // Turn right 90ยบ

turnLeft(1/360);       // Turn left 1ยบ

## move (pen not drawing) and line (drawing)
### Relative
moveBy(x, y); 

lineBy(x, y);

### Absolute
moveTo(x, y); 

lineTo(x, y);

line(x1, y1, x2, y2);
